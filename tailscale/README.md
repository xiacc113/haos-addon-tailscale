# Home Assistant Custom App: Tailscale with features

Zero config VPN for building secure networks.

![Warning][warning_stripe]

> This is a **fork** of the [community app][community_app]!
>
> Changes:
> - Release unreleased changes from community app
>   - Update tailscale/tailscale to v1.98.3
>   - In case of invalid networking DNS settings disable MagicDNS to enable the app to start up
>   - Refactor MagicDNS support to properly handle appconnectors
>   - Refactor slow activities from nm-dispatcher script into separate listener service
>   - Force reauthentication when Tailscale explicitly complains about login server change
>   - Add log_upload config option to configure log upload separately from local app log level
>   - Support Supervised installations
>   - Fix forwarding for local tailnet connections
> - Release pending changes from community app
>   - Make accept_routes, advertise_connector, advertise_exit_node, advertise_routes, taildrop and userspace_networking options default disabled to align with stock Tailscale's platform-specific behavior
>   - Rename tags option to advertise_tags to align with stock Tailscale's naming convention - ***config is automatically updated***
> - Release unmerged changes from community app
>   - Make Tailscale SSH configurable
>   - Make ha cli available in Tailscale SSH sessions (within bash shell with banner and completion)
>   - Create persistent notification also (not just log warning) when key expiration or invalid networking DNS settings are detected
>   - Optionally copy Tailscale Serve's certificate files to /ssl folder
>   - Make DSCP configurable on tailscaled's network traffic
>   - Configure log format for the app to be compatible with Tailscale's format

> One-click migration from the community app to this fork:
> - Install the **Advanced SSH & Web Terminal** app and disable it's protection mode
> - **Please create a complete system backup before executing this script!**
> - From the cli execute: `curl -s -o /tmp/migrate_from_community_app https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiacc113/haos-addon-tailscale/refs/heads/main/scripts/migrate_from_community_app && bashio /tmp/migrate_from_community_app`
>
> **Note:**
> - This will install the forked version (if not alredy installed), backup and
>   stop the community version, copy and update the configuration, and (this is
>   the big thing) will also copy the internal state of the app, then start
>   the forked version.
> - With copying the app internal state, the new forked app will start up
>   with the exact same state, ie. with the same tailnet authentication also. So
>   **do not** remove the current device from Tailscale's admin page, the forked
>   app will jump into it's place.
> - And even if you executed previously some tailscale configuration inside the
>   app's container, those settings will be also migrated with the internal
>   state.
