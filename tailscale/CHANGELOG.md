## 0.28.1.1 (forked)

**Note:** From now on if you are running your own DNS (like AdGuard) **_on
this_** Home Assistant device also, and this device is configured as global
nameserver on the [DNS page](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns) of the admin
console, then you don't need to configure this device differently compared to
other tailnet devices:

1. You should not disable the `accept_dns` option in this case.

1. You don't need to configure your own DNS for Home Assistant

1. You should configure 100.100.100.100 for Home Assistant

1. You should not configure 100.100.100.100 for your tailnet domain as
   upstream DNS server in your own DNS (e.g. in case of AdGuard
   `[/tail1234.ts.net/]100.100.100.100`).

Changes:

- Fix forwarding for local tailnet connections

***BREAKING CHANGES:***
- Fix DNS documentation
- Check DNS configuration

  Before upgrade :
  1. Check that under **Settings** -> **System** -> **Network** Tailscale's DNS is
     ***not*** configured as DNS server.
  1. In the command line execute `ha dns options --servers dns://100.100.100.100`.

     **Note:** _This command replaces the existing DNS server list in Home
     Assistant and restarts the internal DNS server. To specify an empty DNS list
     (i.e. to remove `dns://100.100.100.100` from the list), you must use
     `ha dns reset` and `ha dns restart` commands both. This server list is
     additional and queried before the DNS servers specified in Network settings
     above._

  This is required for the Supervisor to not lose name resolution and network connectivity.
